# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS box-shadow generator. Adjusting CSS, hooking up events to range sliders and general cleaning/re-factoring of code.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm understanding CSS properties much better, but realize how complex it can really get. I mean look at bootstrap and all that fricking code, but in the end it looks pretty good. I'm making adjustments, but my design eye needs improvement. Layout is dull, but that's what practice is for.

### Day 2: March 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
* [modify html label markup for styling](https://github.com/alexmaday/box-shadow-toy/commit/d688af3d65650f5bc74a3b0128e7e36967a8d5fd) - modified the labels to separate the attribute's description from its value using span tags.
* [style label description and range value](https://github.com/alexmaday/box-shadow-toy/commit/d688af3d65650f5bc74a3b0128e7e36967a8d5fd) - used floats.
* and [updated the range labels programatically](https://github.com/alexmaday/box-shadow-toy/commit/d9868463564c5c0a1fd5dc4362ddc7cced6fcf08)

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm solving things, but not in the most elegant way. I know that there's smarter more clever ways to structure code, but I don't know how. But that's what practice is for.
