# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS box-shadow generator. Adjusting CSS, hooking up events to range sliders and general cleaning/re-factoring of code.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm understanding CSS properties much better, but realize how complex it can really get. I mean look at bootstrap and all that fricking code, but in the end it looks pretty good. I'm making adjustments, but my design eye needs improvement. Layout is dull, but that's what practice is for.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
